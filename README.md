# credit-risk-classification

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to build a machine learning model that identifies the creditworthiness of borrowers based on historical lending data.

# Results
- Accuracy Score: 0.99
- Precision Score (Healthy Loan - Label 0): 1.00
- Recall Score (Healthy Loan - Label 0): 1.00
- Precision Score (High-Risk Loan - Label 1): 0.85
- Recall Score (High-Risk Loan - Label 1): 0.91

# Summary
The logistic regression model demonstrates exceptional performance in classifying both healthy loans (label 0) and high-risk loans (label 1) based on the provided classification report. Here's a breakdown of the key results:

- The model achieves an accuracy score of 0.99, indicating its ability to make accurate predictions on the majority of cases.

- For healthy loans (label 0), the model showcases both high precision (1.00) and recall (1.00). This indicates that the model correctly identifies nearly all healthy loans and minimizes the number of false positives.

- For high-risk loans (label 1), the model achieves a precision of 0.85 and a recall of 0.91. While the precision is slightly lower, the model maintains a strong ability to correctly identify high-risk loans, effectively managing potential risks.

In summary, the logistic regression model excels in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans, making it a valuable tool for credit risk assessment. The high accuracy, precision, and recall scores demonstrate its reliability in supporting risk management decisions by identifying loans at risk of default.

We recommend implementing this model to enhance the company's credit risk assessment process, contributing to better-informed lending decisions and minimizing potential losses.
